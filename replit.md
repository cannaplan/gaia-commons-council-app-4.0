# Gaia Commons Council Dashboard

## Overview

Gaia Commons Council is a full-stack dashboard application for tracking pilot program statistics, endowment data, and strategic timeline events for the "One Vote, Forever Fed" 2026 ballot initiative. The platform serves as an analytics and management interface for educational and environmental initiatives, displaying real-time metrics for student enrollment, facility square footage, school counts, and endowment financials. Features include multi-scale deployment views (Pilot → Statewide → National → Global), interactive data visualization charts (Endowment Growth, Jobs Breakdown), and an interactive Cluster Builder tool.

**Statewide Scope**: 1,200 school greenhouses (10,000 sqft avg, 12M sqft total; 70% hydro towers = 8,400,000 sqft/150,000 units, 30% soil beds = 3,600,000 sqft/112,500 beds) at schools with proper infrastructure and space, 900,000 students served, 75 lb produce per student annually (67.5M lb total), $5B endowment (4.5% yield = $225M/year), capex $926M, revenue $1.61B/year, 2,400 FTE jobs, ~3,100 total schools (1,200 with greenhouses). Anti-Boundary Waters mining alternative.

## Recent Changes (January 2026)

  - **Profit Leakage Analysis**:
    - 50% of profits → dividends to Luksic family (Chile)
    - 0.4% gross proceeds tax (vs $3.35/ton for iron mining)
    - 0% of that tax goes to State General Fund (Taconite Area rules)
    - Ore leaves state for processing elsewhere
    - Minnesota left with cleanup liability when mine closes
  - **Side-by-Side Comparison Table**: Mining vs Gaia on ownership, profits, taxes, jobs, duration, wages, resources, environment, post-closure, foreign workers

    - **Prevailing wages**: $32-35/hr depending on scale, 100% local hire priority
    - Key difference: All scales use local union labor vs. foreign contractors at mining sites
- **Endowment Model (Statewide)**: $5B principal @ 4.5% annual draw = $225M/year perpetual funding
  - Principal never touched, grows tax-free
  - After 50 years: $11.25B total draws while principal remains $5B+
  - Produce sales revenue (~$123M/year) covers operations; endowment provides additional safety buffer
- **Land & Water Conservation Fund**: 10% of annual endowment draw dedicated to purchasing and protecting Minnesota's natural resources:

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions
- **Icons**: Lucide React

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with:
- Pages in `client/src/pages/`
- Reusable components in `client/src/components/`
- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`
- shadcn/ui primitives in `client/src/components/ui/`

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints defined in `shared/routes.ts` with Zod validation
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect

The server uses a storage abstraction pattern (`IStorage` interface) in `server/storage.ts` that wraps database operations, making it easier to test and swap implementations.

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM
- **Tables**: 
  - `pilot_stats` - Student counts, square footage, school numbers, status
  - `endowment_stats` - Financial size, annual figures, greenhouse counts
  - `timeline_events` - Year and event descriptions for strategic planning
- **Migrations**: Managed via Drizzle Kit (`drizzle-kit push`)

### Shared Code
The `shared/` directory contains code used by both frontend and backend:
- `schema.ts` - Database schema definitions and Zod insert schemas
- `routes.ts` - API contract definitions with paths, methods, and validation schemas

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, proxied through Express
- **Production Build**: 
  - Frontend: Vite builds to `dist/public/`
  - Backend: esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.cjs`
- **Build Script**: Custom `script/build.ts` handles both builds

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database, connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database toolkit for TypeScript with type-safe queries
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store (available but session management not currently active)

### Frontend Libraries
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Async state management and data fetching
- **Radix UI**: Accessible UI primitives (dialog, dropdown, tooltip, etc.)
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation shared between client and server
- **i18next / react-i18next**: Internationalization framework for multi-language support
- **html2canvas / jsPDF**: PDF export functionality
- **exceljs**: Excel export functionality

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and dev server
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for server code
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration and schema management CLI
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking across the entire codebase

### Replit-Specific Plugins
- `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal`: Error overlay in development
- `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer`: Development tooling (dev only)
- `@replit/vite-plugin-dev-banner`: Development environment indicator (dev only)
